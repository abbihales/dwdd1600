            <h2>Basic things to know about Oil Paints</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Oil paint dries <strong>slowly</strong> through a process called siccativation, where it hardens when it comes into contact with oxygen. This gives painters more time to mix colors and rework their paintings.</li>
                <li>Oil paint is waterproof, making it useful for many practical applications.</li>
                <li>Oil Paints have the ability to create an opaque quality, which is a thickness in the color that omits the passage of light. Oil paintings can also evoke translucent and transparent qualities.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Oil paints have been used for centuries and are favored by many artists due to their versatility (in terms of painting surfaces), color depth, and consistency of the paint, which allows the painter to cover mistakes once the paint dries. In its essence, oil paint is a mixture of powdered pigment and oil (usually a drying oil such as linseed). Oil paintings date back to around the 7th century CE and have been developed profusely throughout the years.</p>
