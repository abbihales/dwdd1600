                What are the best places to travel? If you’re like most people, the allure of new horizons and uncharted adventures keeps you constantly adding destinations to your travel bucket list. Kuoni—a Britain-based travel company— recently did a study to rank the world’s best bucket list destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kuoni conducted the comprehensive analysis by scouring Google search data for 119 bucket list places to visit in 219 countries. The results paint a vivid picture of travel aspirations, spanning from the breathtaking shores of the Maldives to the thundering majesty of Niagara Falls, encompassing iconic landmarks and awe-inspiring natural wonders along the way.

               According to Sheena Paton, senior program manager, this is the first time Kuoni has assembled this travel bucket list . “We’ve previously created travel stories that have analyzed the demand for different locations or the best landmarks to visit, but this unique study looks at every country's most popular bucket list item,” Paton told me in an interview. “We were intrigued to see how this might vary from country to country and which experiences would come out on top, so we decided to do this study to reveal what travelers around the world want to experience.”

           <strong> Great Wall of China’s strength comes from sticky rice</strong>

Workers built the Ming dynasty sections of the Great Wall by mixing together a paste of sticky rice flour and slaked lime, which was the standard ingredient in mortar, the workable paste used to bind building blocks. The sticky rice mortar bound the bricks together so tightly that in many places weeds still cannot grow.
