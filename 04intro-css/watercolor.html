            <h2 id="watercolor-basics">Basic Things to Understand About Watercolor Paints</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Watercolor has a water base, so when mixed with water, the paint becomes loose and is usable.</li>
                <li>Rated 9/10 as the easiest paint to start with, it's often the first paint artists use.</li>
                <li>Watercolor paints have lower pigmentation, creating a lighter color in the finished product.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="watercolor-history">History of Watercolors</h2>
            <p>Chemically, watercolors are pigments made from ground minerals and dyed inert powder, held together generally with gum arabic from the acacia tree. Watercolors capture luminosity and offer a range equal to, and often exceeding, that of other mediums.</p>

            <p>Watercolor is transparent but can be made opaque through repeated wash applications on a white ground, generally paper. It's considered a "light" painting medium compared to other heavy, opaque mediums. This approach is the opposite of oils and acrylics, which typically cover the entire surface opaquely.</p>

            <p>Watercolor allows the white of the paper to show through, enhancing luminosity and creating a feeling of light superior to that of other paints. The more water in the wash, the more the surface's light comes through. For example, cobalt blue becomes increasingly light as it's thinned by water on an absorbent surface.</p>
