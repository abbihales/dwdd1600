            <h2 id="acrylic-history">History of Acrylic Paint</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.pinotspalette.com/naperville/blog/creative-life/pinotspalettenaperville-a-brief-history-of-acrylic-paint-#:~:text=Acrylic%20paint%20is%20a%20fast,by%20artists%20since%20the%201960s." target="_blank">Acrylic paint</a> is a fast-drying type of paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion. Acrylics are water-soluble, but when dry, they become water-resistant. They were first developed in 1934, used in the 1940s, and widely used by artists since the 1960s.</p>

            <p>Two of today’s most popular artist acrylic brands, Golden Artist Colors Inc. and Liquitex, were pioneers in the creation of acrylic paints and mediums. After acrylic resin dispersion was invented in the 1930s in Germany, it was adapted by artist Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden (who went on to be a founder of Golden Artist Colors Inc.) in the creation of the first acrylic paint – a solution of spirit-based paint by the brand name “Magna”.</p>

            <p>The development of acrylic evolved quickly from this point. Sam Golden invented a waterborne acrylic paint called “Aquatec,” taking a step closer to the acrylics we know and love today. Though they are one of the most popular products on our shelves, acrylic paints have had a short history.</p>

            <p>Acrylics helped open up a whole new world for artists. They could be used to create both watercolor-like thin effects and thick, impasto techniques, and could bind to almost any surface. Their faster drying time and bright colors made them ideal for emerging visual art movements like Pop Art.</p>
